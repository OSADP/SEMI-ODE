#Southeast Michigan (SEMI) Operational Data Environment (ODE)
=============================================================
The South East Michigan (SEMI) Operational Data Environment (ODE) is an early 
release of software that was developed to acquire connected vehicle data, 
conduct data valuation, aggregation and integration functions, and provide it 
to clients that have connected to it. While a prior white paper described an 
end-state for the ODE, the current state of the software remains in research & 
development, and is meant to support parallel research with Connected Vehicle 
(CV) Pilots and Connected Cities. 

For further details on the SEMI ODE and emulated client applications, users 
are encouraged to read the specific README files in the ode and ode-client
folders and review documents located in the DOCUMENTATION folder:

* SEMI-ODE_System-Design-Document.pdf: This document details the software 
  architecture and related design decisions needed to implement the SEMI-ODE 
  as part of the USDOT Intelligent Transportation Systems Connected Vehicle 
  Data Program.
* SEMI-ODE_Technical-Report.pdf: This document details how the SEMI-ODE 
  software can be deployed in a hosting environment, and how client 
  applications can interface with it to acquire CV data, in particular, 
  Vehicle Situation Data (VSD) and infrastructure data such as 
  Intersection Situation Data (ISD).
