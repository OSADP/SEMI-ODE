The Vagrant VMs defined in the subfolders requires the Vagrant Program and Virtual Box software to be installed.

Vagrant boxes will download external software on first boot in order to configure themselves. Large external installation files have been intentionally ignored from the repository  in order to keep the repository size compact. Bitami Liferay installer and the Spark files are over 190 MB each. 

Refer to the Vagrant Overview document located in the Develop Doc Folder in the Team's Document Library for more information on setup use of Vagrant.
